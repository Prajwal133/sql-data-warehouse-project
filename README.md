## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture  

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers):  

![Alt text](docs/DWH_HIgh_Level_Architecture.jpg)

- **Bronze Layer**: Stores **raw data** as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from **CSV files** into a **SQL Server database**.  
- **Silver Layer**: Performs **data cleansing, standardization, and normalization** to prepare data for analytics.  
- **Gold Layer**: Contains **business-ready data**, modeled into a **star schema** optimized for reporting and analytics.

### Building Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
